          <h4>Are Tattoos Safe?</h4>
          <p>
            As long as you go to a reputable artist that is following all
            recommended safety precautions, getting a tattoo is perfectly safe.
            Make sure you're fully honest about any medical conditions.

          <h4>Does It Hurt?</h4>
          <p>
            Pain is really relative. Everyone has a different tolerance for
            pain. The pain of a tattoo is often likened to a mild burning
            sensation or a cat scratch. However, the real factor as to how much
            a tattoo hurts is really down to where you intend to get it. But,
            people would not be returning again and again for tattoo after
            tattoo if it hurt that bad.

          <h4>How Much Is It Going to Cost?</h4>
          <p>
            When it comes to tattoos, you get what you pay for. Yes, there are
            plenty of people tattooing out there that will charge very little.
            But, look for quality, and be willing to pay for it. Never haggle
            over the price of a tattoo. It is disrespectful to the artist. Think
            of it this way: This is a piece of art you'll wear for life.

          <h4>What Should I Get? And Where?</h4>
          <p>
            This is all a matter of personal taste. You can get whatever you
            want, and whatever your artist is willing to do. You can choose a
            picture off the wall, or you can have them create a custom piece
            just for you. Your only limit is your own imagination. As far as
            where you should get it goes, just keep in mind what you do for work
            and the type of social circles you are in. You might want to
            consider placing your tattoo where it can be easily covered up with
            normal clothing.

          <h4>How long does a tattoo take?</h4>
          <p>
            Tattooing is not a quick process, nor should it be rushed as you
            will be living with the results permanently. An averagely complex
            piece of work about the size of the back of your hand, usually takes
            about two hours to complete. Larger or more complex pieces can take
            tens of hours, and will require several sittings to complete.
            Usually appointments are made in multiples of hours, but some
            smaller pieces may only require a thirty minute appointment. A full
            sleeve (done by any decent artist), could take anything from ten to
            fifty hours work to complete depending on complexity.

          <h4>How safe is Tattoo Ink?</h4>
          <p>
            It depends where it comes from. There are many inks on the market
            today that are readily available. High quality tattoo ink, Ink has
            been tried and tested over generations without ill effects.
            Nowadays, the manufacture of inks is regulated to meet certain
            health and safety standards, but only in some countries (EU and
            USA). sale of tattoo inks on eBay, has unfortunately opened the
            market up to cheap Chinese inks, and counterfeit copies of well
            known and respected brands. These Chinese inks can be dangerous. A
            report was recently released in which some of these inks had been
            analysed and shown to contain both banned and toxic substances. With
            this in mind, it is no longer good enough that your tattoo artist
            uses trusted brands, they must also source their inks directly from
            the manufacturer, or manufacturer’s approved outlet, to ensure the
            integrity of their product.

          <h4>How long does it take for a tattoo to heal?</h4>
          <p>
            Tattoo healing process depends on several factors, and this includes
            your body and your skin’s ability to heal as well. But as a rule of
            thumb, many tattoo artists agree that the first 2 to 6 weeks is the
            time when your tattoo is most vulnerable, and a crucial healing
            process takes place during this period. This is the time frame when
            you need to take special care of your tattoo. Avoid doing anything
            that may get your tattoo irritated or even become infected. Your
            tattoo artist can only give you instructions of after-care and
            estimates on how long your particular tattoo will heal; but the real
            healing process is highly individual.{" "}

          <h4>How can I prepare before my tattoo session in your studio?</h4>
          <p>
            The rule of thumb is: take care of yourself. Get a good night’s
            sleep. Eat a good meal and make sure you’re well-hydrated. The
            tattooing process is going to take some time. And your body is going
            to be put under some degree of stress because of the tension (your
            body is expecting pain) and experiencing some pain. While most of
            the time, it’s nothing that you couldn’t handle, your body will
            still need the energy and all the support it needs as it receives
            the wound.{" "}

          <h4>Should I shave the area I’m going to tattoo? </h4>
          <p>
            Tattoo artists are usually going to run their razors before a
            session to make sure that the area is completely free of hair before
            they start inking. This is standard procedure.
