# P.ink - personal website for a NYC Tattoo artist Polina Cohen

Polina is a Licensed Independent Artist from New York City who asked me to help her with a personal web site.

I built her website in a minimalistic, clear, black&white design following the mobile-first approach.

I also suggested Polina a new name for her brand - **P.ink**. The former name **c-tattooing** didn't correspond with the new look of her page in my opinion.

I utilized React, Node/Express, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap to build this.
